# Wio_Terminal_E5_LoRa_Tx

A basic demonstration of the Wio Terminal + Wio E5 LoRa capabilities.

Requires [my fork of the LoRaWAN library for Wio Terminal](https://github.com/Kongduino/WioE5_LoRaWAN) to work properly.

This is a work in progress. Some things don't work 100%, and BLE sometimes hangs on startup (a reset is enough to clear the problem). This is in no way a commercial-grade product â€“ and shouldn't be used as such anyway, see license.

Play around with it and ask questions in [Issues](https://github.com/Kongduino/Wio_Terminal_E5_LoRa_Tx/issues) if you need help.
